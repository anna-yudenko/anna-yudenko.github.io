# About me

I'm Anna, a biophysicist with background in Solid-state Physics. I work as a
researcher in Laboratory of Structural Analysis and Engineering of Membrane
Systems.

I completed my PhD at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, where
I studied flavin-binding fluorescent proteins and engineered fluorescent
microscopy tools based on them.

I'm very interested in Protein Engineering and Synthetic biology.
